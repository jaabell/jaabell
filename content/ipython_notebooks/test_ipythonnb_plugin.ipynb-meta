Summary: In this post I'll make a small example meant to test the [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) + [Pelican](www.getpelican.org) integration thanks to the plugin created by [danielfrg](http://danielfrg.com/blog/2013/03/08/pelican-ipython-notebook-plugin/) that can be found [here](https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipythonnb).
