This simulation, done in the UCD ESSI simulator and visualized in VisIt using VisIt-ESSI plugin, shows the passage of a surface wave (Rayleigh wave). The simulation consists on a surface impact on an elastic domain of 900m by 1800m depth, and a shear wave velocity of 1000km/s. Elliptical-retrograde motion can be seen as an illustration of Rayleigh waves.

VisIt can be obtained [here](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/), and the plugin [here](https://github.com/jaabell/visitESSI).
