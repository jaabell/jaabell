Biography
==========

I am a PhD student at UCDavis [CompGeoMech][CompGeoMech] since Sept 2011, working on our in-house high-performance FEM simulation system. I come from Chile, where I did my undergraduate studies in structural engineering, leading to a professional degree in the specialty, at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. Then, I proceeded to do my MS at the same institution in Civil Engineering. My MS thesis was more focused into the hazard part of earthquake engineering. 

My current research focuses on high-performance Earthquake-Soil-Structure interaction (ESSI) simulation. In a nutshell, it consists in modeling the effect of earthquake on structures from the earthquake source rupture process all the way up to a structure and its contents. The idea is to find out how and when a more accurate ESSI simulation yields different results from what is currently done in practise, and if this leads to safer and more economical designs. 

Parallel, high-performance computing is an enabling technology in this endeavor and there are many opportunities along the process where leveraging parallelism is possible. Meshing, simulation, and post-processing are important examples of these.
