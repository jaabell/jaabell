I am a chilean professor working at [Universidad de los Andes][] in the [Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences](ing.uandes.cl). 

My main research focuses on the study of structure-soil systems under earthquake loading, through modeling and simulation. An important aspect of my research is that I place strong emphasis on the correct description of seismic wave propagation from source to site. 

A major goal for me is to leverage the use of high-performance computing as the enabling technology that will allow the profession to move forward in terms of the power of analysis available to engineers.
