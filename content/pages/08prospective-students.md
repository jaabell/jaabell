With the recent opening of our Master of Science (MS) and PhD programs, which is oriented to research in the field of civil infrastructure systems, students are now being sought to pursue this degree by doing research with me. More information on the program can be found [here](http://ing.uandes.cl/postgrado/magister-en-ciencias-de-la-ingenieria-mencion-sistemas-de-infraestructura/).

Completion of the master's/PhD program typically leads to the publication of a scientific article (paper) in a top journal (Q1 ranking on JCR Thompson Reuters) in the fields of computational mechanics, earthquake engineering, nonlinear/probabilistic dynamics, to name a few, which would boost the students CV immensely. 

National or international students interested in pursuing such a degree should contact me directly.
