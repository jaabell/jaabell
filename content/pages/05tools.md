**Tools I've (Cr)eated/(Co)ntributed to**

-   <span style="line-height: 14px;">[RealESSI Simulator][] - (Co) UCD
    Earthquake-Soil-Structure Interaction simulator system. </span>
-   [FEI-Syntax-n-Snippets][] - (Cr) - Syntax highlighter and snippets
    for the Finite Element Interpreter (A domain specific language for
    FEA modelling within ESSI Simulator).
-   [visitESSI][] - (Cr) - A plugin for visualizing ESSI Simulator HDF5
    output.
-   [gmshtranslator][] - (Cr) - A python parser for gmsh `.msh` format. I use it to create ESSI models.

**3rd. Party tools**

I strive to stay as open source/free as I can with the tools I use.
Every now and then, though, I will pay for a useful tool.

Here is a set of apps I love to use day to day. Thanks to their
creators.

-   <span style="line-height: 14px;">[Spyder][] - A very cool, Matlab
    inspired, python editor for scientific computing.</span>
-   [SciPy][] - Scientific computing for Python. The reason I switched
    from Matlab to Python!
-   [Code::Blocks][] - Open source, very powerful IDE for C++ projects.
-   [gmsh][] - Need to generate 3D FEM meshes? gmsh will do that and
    more.
-   [STLfilt][] - A filter for compiler output. Very useful when dealing
    with STL and template metaprogramming. Makes reading error reports
    very easy.
-   [LTensor][]- A high performance C++ library for dealing with tensors
    (up to rank 4) based on templates. Deal with tensors in C++
    using natural notation !
-   [Inkscape][] - My dark alternate identity, a designer. Useful vector
    graphics editor to create beautiful illustrations.
-   [Sublime Text][] - A very cool text editor. (Free to try, but have
    to buy to keep using)
    -   <address>
        I also created a syntax highlighter and "snippets" package for
        this editor for our FEI Finite Element simulation program (ESSI)
        [[here][FEI-Syntax-n-Snippets]]. Can be installed easily into
        sublime with [Package Control plugin][] (FEI-syntax-n-snippets).

-   [GIMP][] - The Gnu Image Manipulation Program. My designer side
    flourishing again.

As far as OSes go

-   [Ubuntu][] - What? There are other Linux distributions out there?
-   [elementary OS][] - Interesting and pretty Ubuntu-based linux distro. Inspired by mac.
