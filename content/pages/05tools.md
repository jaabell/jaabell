**Tools I've (Cr)eated/(Co)ntributed to**

-   [OpenSees][] - (Co) UC Berkeley
-   [RealESSI Simulator][] - (Co) UCD
    Earthquake-Soil-Structure Interaction simulator system. </span>
-   [FEI-Syntax-n-Snippets][] - (Cr) - Syntax highlighter and snippets
    for the Finite Element Interpreter (A domain specific language for
    FEA modelling within ESSI Simulator).
-   [visitESSI][] - (Cr) - A plugin for visualizing ESSI Simulator HDF5
    output.
-   [gmshtranslator][] - (Cr) - A python parser for gmsh `.msh` format. I use it to create ESSI/OpenSees/whateverelse models.

**3rd. Party tools**

I strive to stay as open source/free as I can with the tools I use. Every now and then, though, I will pay for a useful tool.

Here is a set of apps I love to use day to day. Special thanks to their creators.

-   [Sublime Text][] - A very cool text editor. (Free to try, but have to buy to keep using)
-   [SciPy][] - Scientific computing for Python. The reason I switched from Matlab to Python!
-   [Mendeley][] - Oh how would I ever manage references without you dear mendeley?
-   [Code::Blocks][] - Open source, very powerful IDE for C++ projects.
-   [gmsh][] - Need to generate 3D FEM meshes? gmsh will do that and more.
-   [STLfilt][] - A filter for compiler output. Very useful when dealing with STL and template metaprogramming. Makes reading error reports very easy.
-   [LTensor][]- A high performance C++ library for dealing with tensors (up to rank 4) based on templates. Deal with tensors in C++ using natural notation !
-   [ARM Forge] - A parallel-debugger/profiler suite. There is really no open-source alternative that can provide the productivity these guys provide. Costly though. 
-   [Inkscape][] - My dark alternate identity, a designer. Useful vector graphics editor to create beautiful illustrations.
    -   <address> I also (cr)eated a syntax highlighter and "snippets" package for this editor for our FEI Finite Element simulation program (ESSI) [[here][FEI-Syntax-n-Snippets]]. Can be installed easily into sublime with [Package Control plugin][] (FEI-syntax-n-snippets). </address>
-   [Spyder][] - A very cool, Matlab inspired, python editor for scientific computing. I don't use this anymore, it was a catalyst for my transition from matlab to python. I do recommend it to my students and matlab-based colleagues. 
-   [GIMP][] - The Gnu Image Manipulation Program. My designer side flourishing again.
-   [Blender][] - Used for cool 3-D viz and random art I do. 

As far as OSes go

-   [Ubuntu][] - What? There are other Linux distributions out there?
-   [elementary OS][] - Interesting and pretty Ubuntu-based linux distro. Inspired by mac.
-   [Virtual Box] - Because sometimes you just need windows (because other people can't linux).
