This work presents a critical state plasticity model for predicting the response of sands to cyclic loading. The well-known bounding surface SANISAND framework by Dafalias & Manzari (2004) is enhanced with a `memory surface' to capture micro-mechanical, fabric-related processes directly effecting cyclic sand behaviour. The resulting model, SANISAND-MS, was recently proposed by Liu et al. (2019) , and successfully applied to the simulation of drained sand ratcheting under thousands of loading cycles. Herein, novel ingredients are embedded into Liu et al. (2019) 's formulation to better capture the effects of fabric evolution history on sand stiffness and dilatancy. The new features enable remarkable accuracy in simulating undrained pore pressure build-up and cyclic mobility behaviour in medium-dense/dense sand. The performance of the upgraded SANISAND-MS is validated against experimental test results from the literature - including undrained cyclic triaxial tests at varying cyclic loading conditions and pre-cyclic consolidation histories. The proposed modelling platform will positively impact the study of relevant cyclic/dynamic problems, for instance, in the fields of earthquake and offshore geotechnics.
