Serviceability checks for offshore monopiles include the estimation of long-term, permanent tilt under repeated operational loads. In the lack of well-established analysis methods, experimental and numerical research has been carried out in the past decade to support fundamental understanding of soil-monopile interaction mechanisms, and the conception of engineering methods for monopile tilt predictions. With focus on the case of monopiles in sand, this work shows how step-by-step/implicit, three-dimensional finite element modelling can be fruitfully applied to analyse cyclic soil-monopile interaction and related deformation mechanism. For proper simulation of cyclic sand ratcheting and densification around the pile, the recent SANISAND-MS model by Liu et al. (2019) is adopted. Results of numerical simulations confirm relevant features of monopile tilt observed in experimental data from the literature, e.g., regarding the influence of (single-amplitude) cyclic loading settings. The validity of an upscaled Miner's rule regarding monopile tilt under multi-amplitude cyclic loading is also numerically confirmed.
