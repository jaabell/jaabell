The need to build tall buildings has been increasing worldwide, creating new
challenges in earthquake engineering and design. Many of the current analysis
methods cannot be extrapolated beyond the definition under which they were
established. Prior studies and existing seismic design guidelines have indicated that
the current fixed-base hypothesis for evaluating the seismic response of structures is
not sufficient to properly represent the boundary conditions and behavior of tall
buildings with basement levels. Studies of soil-structure interaction (SSI) for tall
buildings have, however, typically been inconclusive. It is not clear under which
conditions consideration of soil-basement-structure interaction (SBSI) is necessary for
the design of the superstructure, foundation, and basement levels and when it can
safely be avoided. Given the rising demand, it is essential to evaluate the relation of
global system variables such as the basement depth, structure height, and soil
characteristics with the building's response via numerical and experimental modeling.
Therefore, an experimental-numerical approach is presented to better understand the
seismic response of tall buildings with basement levels, considering explicit SBSI
modeling. Chilean tall buildings and soil conditions are used as study cases, analyzed
using non-linear finite element analyses in conjunction with results from centrifuge
experiments. The results show how seismic response parameters and modals
characteristics, such as inter-story drifts, shear force, bending moment, natural
frequencies and damping ratios, change when SBSI is appropriately incorporated. The
results point to the importance of considering soil-basement-interaction effects to
evaluate the seismic response of tall buildings with basement levels and avoid unsafe
estimations or the need for overdesign.
