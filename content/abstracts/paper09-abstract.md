The modeling of structural damping due to the excitation of elastic-waves into
the surrounding soil domain, and its effect on structural response as apparent
modal damping is explored herein. Four high-fidelity, linear finite-element mod-
els of building-site systems, with 20 to 50 storeys and 2 to 7 basement levels, are
simulated in OpenSees to evaluate their frequency response. Radiation-damping is
provided by a layer of high-damping elements, which design is explored in detail.
Results show that up to 1% of apparent, low-amplitude damping can be attributed
to radiation-damping depending on number of stories and depth of embedment.
