The modelling and simulation of cyclic sand ratcheting is tackled via a plasticity model formulated withinthe well-known critical state, bounding surface SANISAND framework. For this purpose, a third locus –termed ‘memory surface’ – is cast into the constitutive formulation, so as to phenomenologically capturemicro-mechanical, fabric-related processes directly relevant to the cyclic response. The predictive capabilityof the model under numerous loading cycles (‘high-cyclic’ loading) is explored with focus on drainedloading conditions, and validated against experimental test results from the literature – including triaxial,simple shear and oedometer cyclic loading. The model proves capable of reproducing the transition fromratcheting to shakedown response, in combination with a single set of soil parameters for different initial,boundary and loading conditions. This work contributes to the analysis of soil-structure interaction underhigh-cyclic loading events, such as those induced by environmental and/or traffic loads.
