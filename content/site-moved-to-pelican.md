Summary: I moved my site to pelican 

Finally completed the transition from WordPress to Pelican. The moment was right. Pelican is more
appropriate for me as it is much simpler to manage (I host my own webpage), more flexible in terms
of what I can do with the blog, requires no php or database knowledge.

Pelican is a python powered static HTML generator. I set-up a heierarchy of folders where I store
my content. Web content is generated using the Markdown text syntax. Pelican uses these markdown
files and the folder structure to generate the website HTML. 

Static HTML has some advantages over a database with server-side logic based website. The most
important for me is speed and low memory usage, because I want to host my own website. 

Also, it makes it easier to share code. 

Finally, I can version control the website using git.

I love pelican!
