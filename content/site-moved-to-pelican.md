Summary: I moved my site to pelican 

Finally completed the transition from WordPress to Pelican. The moment was right. Pelican is more
appropriate for me as it is much simpler to manage (I host my own webpage), more flexible in terms
of what I can do with the blog, requires no php or database knowledge.

Also, it makes it easier to share code. 

I love pelican!
